      <p> I got my <strong><u>driver's license</u></strong> last week <br>
      Just like we always talked about <br>
      'Cause you were so excited for me <br>
      To finally drive up to your house <br>
      But today I drove through the suburbs <br>
      Crying 'cause you weren't around <br> </p>

      <p>
      And you're probably with that blonde girl <br>
      Who always made me doubt <br>
      She's so much older than me <br>
      She's everything I'm insecure about <br>
      Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs <br>
      'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <br>
      </p>
      <p>
      And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one <br>
      And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone <br>
      Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <br>
      'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <br>
      </p>
      <p>
      And all my friends are tired <br>
      Of hearing how much I miss you, but <br>
      I kinda feel sorry for them <br>
      'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah <br>
      Today I drove through the suburbs <br>
      And pictured I was driving home to you <br>
      </p>
      <p>
      And I know we weren't perfect <br>
      But I've never felt this way for no one, oh <br>
      And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone <br>
      I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <br>
      'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <br>
      </p>
      Red lights, stop signs <br>
      I still see your face in the white cars, front yards <br>
      Can't drive past the places we used to go to <br>
      'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) <br>
      <p>
      Sidewalks we crossed <br>
      I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing <br>
      Over all the noise <br>
      God, I'm so blue, know we're through <br>
      But I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) <br>
      </p>
      <p>
      I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
      And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
      'Cause you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
      'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
      Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
